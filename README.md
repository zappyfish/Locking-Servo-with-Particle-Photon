# Locking-Servo-with-Particle-Photon
This is a web app (and particle code) that allows you to turn a servo connected to your photon after entering a password

# How to use
Edit the passcode html to set your password and flash the photon code to your particle photon. 
Then, using the photon_setup page, you can enter your deviceID and accessToken and test the connection. You will receive 
an alert if you connected successfully. When you move to the next page, you can then enter your password to turn the servo 
on the photon or hit the relock button to return it to the 90 degrees position.
